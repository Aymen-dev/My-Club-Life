    <h2><strong>What is a Club ?</strong></h2>
    <p>Clubs in universities are organizations that bring together students with shared interests, goals, or
        backgrounds. They provide an avenue for students to connect with like-minded individuals, develop new skills,
        and engage in activities outside of their academic studies. Clubs cover a wide range of areas, from sports,
        arts, and music to social, cultural, and academic pursuits. Joining a club is important for students as it can
        enhance their university experience by providing a sense of community, fostering friendships, and building
        leadership and teamwork skills. Clubs also offer opportunities to network, volunteer, and engage with the wider
        community, which can enrich a student's personal and professional development. Whether it's learning a new
        language, playing a sport, or advocating for a cause, there's a club out there for every student, and joining
        one can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience.</p>
